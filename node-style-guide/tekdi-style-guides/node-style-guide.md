### Node.js Styling Tools

### Introduction:
This configuration file integrates ESLint and Prettier to enforce coding standards and ensure consistent code formatting within our  project. It leverages various ESLint plugins and rules to maintain code quality and readability.

Setting up ESLint with Prettier in your Node.js project helps maintain code quality and consistent code formatting standards across your codebase.
ESLint checks for code errors, enforces coding style rules, and supports JavaScript and TypeScript-specific configurations, while Prettier automatically formats code to ensure consistent styling such as indentation, line breaks, and quote styles.
