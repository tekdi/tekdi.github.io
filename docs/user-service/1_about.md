# About

The Teacher's Web Application helps facilitators easily manage their own and students' attendance, organize student groups (cohorts), and handle assessments. Facilitators can mark and view attendance, manage student groups, and distribute assessments. Students can complete assessments online, and facilitators can view their scores. It's a simple and efficient tool for managing classroom activities.
