# Features

## Features of the Teacher's Web Application

1. **Attendance Management**
   - Facilitators can mark their own and students' attendance for current and past days.
   - Easily mark attendance for multiple students at once.
   - View past attendance records.
   - If a co-facilitator marks attendance, others can’t change it.
   - If no attendance is marked, that day isn’t counted in the attendance percentage.

2. **Center Management**
   - Facilitators and team leaders can create and manage student groups (cohorts) by location (State, District, Block, Village).
   - Facilitators can add students to their cohorts.
   - Mark students as dropouts, which disables their attendance or assessment activities but keeps their records.

3. **Assessment Management**
   - Facilitators can share a link for students to take MCQ-based assessments.
   - Students can log in, complete the test, and view their scores.
   - Facilitators can view students' scores on each question.

These features make it easy for teachers to manage attendance, organize students into cohorts, and handle assessments efficiently.
